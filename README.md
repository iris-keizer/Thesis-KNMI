# Thesis-KNMI
This repository contains all the code used during my research project at KNMI for the Climate Physics master between february 2021 and february 2022. The research focusses on interdecadal wind contribution to sea level rise at the Dutch coast. 

The project is splitted first in directories refering to the subpart of the project.
'Wind_contribution' includes the notebooks, code and figures for the regression analysis between sea level and wind
'AMV'  includes the notebooks, code and figures for the regression analysis between AMV data and wind contribution to sea level rise (not there yet)
'SST'  includes the notebooks, code and figures for the regression analysis between SST data and wind contribution to sea level rise (not there yet)

Than its splitted between 'Analysis' and 'Data preparation'.
'Data preparation' includes notebooks and code for preprocessing the data before executing the analysis. E.g. obtaining annual averages, calculating wind stress, changing the time period or area.
'Analysis'  includes notebooks and code for actually executing the regression analysis

Each directory than contains 'notebooks', where notebooks can be found. Here, also a folder 'code' can be found containing python scripts that contain modules used to execute the notebooks.
